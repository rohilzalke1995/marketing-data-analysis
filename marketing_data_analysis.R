#Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
#pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the company believes that maximizing the number of annual members will
#be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a
#very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic
#program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

#Company has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to
#do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why
#casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are
#interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
